# SONAR-Rock-Mine-Pediction
This algorithm traing on and analyses SONAR data to predict whether an object is a rock or a mine using simple Logistic Regression.
> I chose a Logistic Regression as it was the widely considered as effective for binary classification.

## How To Run
1. Cone the repository to your local or training enviroment

	`git clone https://github.com/harazin/SONAR-Rock-Mine-Pediction.git`

2. Manually add the desired SONAR data entry to a variable and pass it into the **predict_result()** function.

	`predict_result(MY_SONAR_DATA)`

3. The *main.py* file automatically trains on the dataset in the content folder, and will return the prediction based on the input.
